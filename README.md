## Question 1
To run the code, run main.cpp from the question 1 folder and follow the prompts. 

The code will ask for an expression. When entering in an expression, make sure there are spaces between each operand, operator, and bracket.
It will check if it is balanced, and if it is, it will provide the postfix expression.

## Question 2
To run the code, run main.cpp from the question 2 folder.

The code will first check if the queue is empty, which it is. It will add the elements 11, 22, 33, 44 to the queue. Then it will check the item at the front of the queue, which is 11. 
It will pop the first element, making the first element 22. Now, the size of the queue is 3, and the queue is not empty.
